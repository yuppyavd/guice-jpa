/**
 * <p>Provider for {@link EntityManager}.</p>
 * <p>This class does not implement the {@link Provider} interface because the {@link EntityManager}
 * objects do have a life cycle and should therefore not be stored in instance/member variables.</p>
 * <p>The {@link UnitOfWork} defines the life cycle of the {@link EntityManager}. An entity manager
 * will be created when the unit of work is started. It is open and valid for use during the entire
 * unit of work. When the unit of work ends the entity manager is closed and can no longer
 * be used.</p>
 * <p>It is a good practice to store this provider in a instance/member variable and only obtain an
 * {@link EntityManager} instance in a Method where it is used. This ensures that the method always
 * has access to a valid {@link EntityManager}.</p>
 * <p>The {@link EntityManagerProvider} is thread save.</p>
