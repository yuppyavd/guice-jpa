/**
 * <p>The Unit of work correlates with the life cycle of the {@link EntityManager}.
 * According to JPA every thread should use its own {@link EntityManager}. Therefore the unit of
 * work will control the life cycle of the {@link EntityManager} on a per thread basis. This means
 * the UnitOfWork is thread safe.</p>
 * <p>Most of the time it is not recommended to manual control the unit of work.</p>
 * <p>For applications running in a container the {@link PersistenceFilter} is recommended.
 * It will start a unit of work for every incoming request and properly close it at the end.</p>
 * <p>For stand alone application it is recommended to relay on the @{@link Transactional} annotation.
 * The transaction handler will automatically span a unit of work around a transaction.</p>
 * <p>The most likely scenario in which one would want to take manual control over the unit of work
 * is in a background thread within a container (i.e. timer triggered jobs).</p>
 * <p>Recommended pattern:</p>
 * <pre>
 * public void someMethod() {
 *   final boolean unitOfWorkWasInactive = ! unitOfWork.isActive();
 *   if (unitOfWorkWasInactive) {
 *     unitOfWork.begin();
 *   }
 *   try {
 *     // do work
 *   }
 *   finally {
 *     if (unitOfWorkWasInactive) {
 *       unitOfWork.end();
 *     }
 *   }
